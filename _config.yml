  The staff at St. Monica believes passionately that learning should be an adventure.  They use the
  Reggio Emilia approach to early childhood education, which encourages young children and their teachers
  to explore, question, and discover in a stimulating environment. Birds nesting in the trees, ladybugs in
  the plants, and leaves overhead allow for endless teaching opportunities in this outdoor classroom.

# Feature
- title: Connection to Nature
  description: >
    The play space will be full of plants that are native to the area. All trees, shrubs and fallen logs are designed to bring nature in and provide children a natural space to play and learn. In these types of playgrounds children gain respect for their environment and understand their place in it.

# Feature
- title: Suggestive Design
  description: >
    Natural environments have advantages over purpose built playground because they stimulate more diverse and creative play. Children are encouraged to explore and create without limitations placed upon them by the designer.

portfolio-title: Design Concept
portfolio-description: >
  The Naturescape has been carefully designed to ensure that there are many opportunities for the children to explore
  and create. Gross motor skills will be strengthened using natural elements such as the double tree mash with rope
  climbers, boulders, horizontal log and stump borders and varying topography. Gardening, music, sensory bins and
  varying textures are all incorporated to develop fine motor skills that are valuable to child development.
  This space will encourage children to touch, feel, and collect creating sensory experiences they won't forget.
