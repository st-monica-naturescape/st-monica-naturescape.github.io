We are excited to announce that Phase 1 of the Naturescape project will be completed this spring!

Phase 1 will include the garden and gathering area, the vegetative tipi, the wacky posts and loose parts area, the music and artistic areas, the large sandbox with log tunnel and sensory bins as well as the north part of the path.

In the mean time, we will continue to work hard to raise the additional funds necessary for Phase 2.
