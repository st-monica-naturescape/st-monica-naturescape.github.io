We want to give a big shout out to Nancy Bromley, the Assistant Principal at St Monica, for all her work putting together a submission for a Champion Projects Fund grant.

We recently learned that her submission was successful and we have been awarded $2,300 from the Edmonton Catholic Schools Foundation to be put towards the tipi and associated vegetation.

Way to go Nancy!
