We want to send out a huge congratulations to our designer, Jeff Lindstrom, and his team on their recent win of the Landscape Ontario Award for Design for their submission of the St. Monica Naturescape concept plan!

We all know that the design is spectacular, but we now have the award to prove it! Well done team!

If you would like to see the presentation board that Jeff submitted in person, please stop by the school to take a look!
