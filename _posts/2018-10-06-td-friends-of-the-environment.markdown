We are thrilled to announce that we have been awarded a \$40,000 grant from the TD Friends of the Environment Foundation! TD FEF supports a wide range of environmental initiatives with the primary focus on environmental education and green space programs, which fits very nicely with our Naturescape plans.

The $40,000 received will be used as matching funds against our CFEP grant which means that this essentially has opened up $80,000 of funds for this project. Funds will be primarily used to cover the cost of trees, shrubs, and sod.

Thank you TD-FEF for helping us get one step closer to achieving our goal!
