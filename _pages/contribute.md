There are many ways that you can help us get this amazing Naturescape built this spring.

We are looking for:

1. Help identifying and applying for grants or other funding opportunities
2. Help deciding what the "Donor Recognition Feature” will be to thank our supporters
3. Help finding a talented and experienced local landscape company that can cooperatively work along with our Design team from Bienenstock Design and Consulting to install the Naturescape.
4. Discounts and donations of materials that can be used in the Naturescape
5. And so much more!

What gifts and talents can you contribute?

Please e-mail us at [stmonicanaturescape@gmail.com](mailto:stmonicanaturescape@gmail.com) to get involved.
