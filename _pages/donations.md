Your cooperation using this method of payment is greatly appreciated.

 1. Login to your St. Monica student’s Powerschool account at [https://powerschool.ecsd.net](https://powerschool.ecsd.net)
 2. Go to the “School Fees” tab
 3. View school fees
 4. Select your St. Monica students name from the tab at the top
 5. Locate the relevant “Naturescape” icon in the “Additional Items” section

You can add to cart as many donation values as you care to contribute.

Please note that in order for a donation receipt to be issued and recognition to be provided, the
<a href="">following form</a> will need to accompany your donation. If you are sending the form to school with a
student, please ensure that the envelope is clearly marked “Naturescape". Thank you!

Donation receipts will be issued by ECSD once per calendar year, likely in February.
